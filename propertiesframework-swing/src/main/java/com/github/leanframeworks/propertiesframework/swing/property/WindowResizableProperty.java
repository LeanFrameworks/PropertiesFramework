/**
 * Readable/writable property representing the resizable state of a {@link Frame} or a {@link Dialog}.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to control the resizable state of the component by setting the value of this property or by calling
 * the {@link Frame#setResizable(boolean)} or {@link Dialog#setResizable(boolean)} method of that window.
 * <p>
 * Please note that a plain {@link Window} does not have this bean property. A {@link Frame}, {@link Dialog} or
 * sub-class does. However, the type {@link Window} is still used by this property for convenience.
 * <p>
 * Finally note that null values are not supported by this property.
