# PropertiesFramework

The PropertiesFramework is a simple, flexible and extensible Java component that is:
* A library providing properties, property binding and property injection capabilities;
* A framework to build your own properties.

It is not meant to duplicate all JavaFX properties and their features, but rather to bring a very simple, lightweight,
yet flexible, similar concept to non-JavaFX application. So it can be used to bring properties and bindings to Swing!

# Roadmap

Version 1.0.0: Better use of generics and wildcards. Take advantage of Java 8 (functional interfaces, support for lambda
expressions and method references, etc.). So the interface value change listeners related to sets, lists and maps will
change.

Version 1.1.0: Addition of a property injection mechanism.
