# PropertiesFramework

The PropertiesFramework is a simple, flexible and extensible Java component that is:
* A library providing properties, property binding and property injection capabilities;
* A framework to extend it and build your own properties.

It is not meant to duplicate all JavaFX properties and their features, but rather to bring a very simple, lightweight,
yet flexible, similar concept to non-JavaFX application. So it can be used to bring properties and bindings, for
example, to Swing!

This project is extracted from the [ValidationFramework](https://github.com/padrig64/ValidationFramework), which will
later be migrated to use this project as its foundation. 

# Roadmap

The main changes expected in the upcoming releases are the following:
* Version 1.1.0: Add of a property injection mechanism to help implementing a more composable, scalable MVC/MVP pattern
* Version 2.0.0: Harmonize Dispose and DeepDispose interfaces
